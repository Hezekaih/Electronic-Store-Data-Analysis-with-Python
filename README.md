# Electronic-Store-Sales-Data-Analysis-with-Python
Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks Set of a real- world data science tasks completed using the Python Pandas library.
# Problem Statement
In this project, I use Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc. 

# 1.1 Cleaning the data:
- Drop NaN values from DataFrame
- Removing rows based on a condition
- Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

# 1.2 Questions Answered
- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
- What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customers buying products?
- What products are most often sold together?
- What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
